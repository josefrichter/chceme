Chceme app ("chceme" in Czech means "we want" in English)

uses Rails 3 beta 4 (running on Ruby 1.8.7 p294), mongoid 2.0.0.beta7

My experiment with MongoDB, using MongoID ORM.

- a simple app where you can post Suggestions and their Features (Suggestion embeds_many Features)
- you can vote on both Suggestions and their individual Features (plus/minus votes)
- there's embed association = Suggestion embeds_many Features
- there's polymorphic relational association Suggestion/Feature has_many_related Votes (although the polymorphic implementation sucks)
- testing: Cucumber, Capybara, RSpec, Pickle, Machinist (having trouble to make Pickle+Machinist work with MongoID right now)
- User model not implemented yet, but gonna add Devise...

feel free to reuse and share any hints how to improve the code
